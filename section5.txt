To handle payments securely, I would create a server endpoint that starts a Stripe Checkout Session. 
I would attach the application_id as hidden metadata to this session so we can link the payment back to the correct user. 
The frontend then simply redirects the user to Stripe’s hosted page to pay.

Crucially, I wouldn't trust the user's browser to confirm the payment. 
Instead, I would listen for a Stripe Webhook (a secure background message) on my server. 
When Stripe notifies me that the checkout.session.completed, 
I would verify the message is authentic, use the stored ID to find the application, 
mark the status as 'Paid', and automatically move the application stage to 'Submitted'.
